## Introduction
I started the project because I wanted to create a shining svg image.  
Anything that shines, such as a star or fire, is fine.

## Getting Started
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
